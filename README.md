## Neural Networks for Modeling of Electrical Parameters and Losses in Electric Vehicle
[Publication](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1789150&dswid=1220)

Artificial neural network and other machine learning models including k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and multiple linear regression with a quadratic model are developed to predict electrical parameters and losses as new prediction approaches for the performance of Volvo Carsâ€™ electric vehicles and evaluate their performance.
