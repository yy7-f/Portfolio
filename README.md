Artificial neural network and other machine learning models including k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and multiple linear regression with a quadratic model are developed to predict electrical parameters and losses as new prediction approaches for the performance of Volvo Cars’ electric vehicles and evaluate their performance.  
Grid search with 5-fold cross validation was implemented to optimize hyperparameters of artificial neuralnetwork and machine learning models.   
The artificial neural network models performed the best in MSE and R-squared scores for all the electrical parameters and loss prediction. The results indicate that artificial neural networks are more successful at handling complicated nonlinear relationships like those seen in electrical systems compared with other machine learning algorithms.  
Also, PCA analysis and correlation matrix analysis are conducted.  
This projected was implemented at Volvo Cars Corporation as a Master thesis project.

## Brain Tumor Segmentation using Unet
Unet models optimized with the Dice Loss and binary cross entropy loss are developed for brain tumor segmentation using brain MRI images dataset. The dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks. After 25 epochs training, the dice coefficient acheived around 0.8.

## Maintenance Prediction for Turbofan Jet Engine
LSTM, RNN, and 1D-CNN models were developed for regression and classification tasks using time series data. Dimension reduction was also conducted through data analysis. Regression objective is Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of a machine. Classification objective is Predicting the failure of machine in upcoming specific periods

## Virtual sorting system using image classfication, vision algorithm, virtual modeling, PLC programming, and robot operation
Product sorting system in virtual production line is developed in this project.
The sorting production line is built using virtual modeling (Simumatik), PLC programming (Codesys), vision algorithm (Python, OpenCV, OPCUA), image classification (CNN, Transfer learning, and HoG + ML), and robot operation (ABB Robot studio).

## DCGAN for generating new data using MNIST dataset

Developed DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) with Pytorch to generate new data using MNIST handwritten digit data.



## Car Rating Classification
Developed machine learning algorithms to predict the class value of a particular car based on the vehicle’s features. Categorical data was encoded followed by order. Three algorithms including k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest are executed with 10-fold cross-validation. The results are visualized and compared using confusion matrices and box plots.
