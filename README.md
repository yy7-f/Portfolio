## Maintenance Prediction for Turbofan Jet Engine
LSTM, RNN, and 1D-CNN models are developed for regression and classification tasks using time series data.  
Regression objective: Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of a machine  
Classification objective: Predicting the failure of machine in upcoming specific periods

## Virtual sorting system using image classfication, vision algorithm, virtual modeling, PLC programming, and robot operation
Product sorting system in virtual production line is developed in this project.
The sorting production line is built using virtual modeling (Simumatik), PLC programming (Codesys), vision algorithm (Python, OpenCV, OPCUA), image classification (CNN, Transfer learning, and HoG + ML), and robot operation (ABB Robot studio).

# Car_rating_classification
Developed machine learning algorithms to predict the class value of a particular car based on the vehicle’s features. Categorical data was encoded followed by order. Three algorithms including k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, and random forest are executed with 10-fold cross-validation. The results are visualized and compared using confusion matrices and box plots.
